## Around Me for College 



> <p>The main idea for developing this project is to develop a search engine based on android app which will maintain data of all events held in the college. This android app helps the main event co-originator/ manager to schedule tasks and communicate with them effectively.</p>



> <p>The event manager can make use of internet for communication and notifying alerts about particular tasks or work schedule to key volunteers of the events so that more people can access the relevant information with ease. The interested candidates can register themselves online.</p>

> <p>The list of registered candidates is directly sent to that concerned event coordinator and list of shortlisted candidates is then updated and they are notified by an e-mail as well as an SMS alert.</p>
