##Faculty - Parent Communication Register



> <p>The Main aim of our Parent Communication Register Android Application is to automate the attendance in the form of Android Mobile Application. Our intention is to establish a good communication between Student Mentor and parent.</p>
> This Android application will give the students attendance information and SMS notification feature whereby every parent will be periodically notified regarding his/her child attendance

> This Application primarily focuses on building an efficient and user friendly  Mobile application.
