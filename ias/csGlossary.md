# Computer Science Glossary

**tl;dr 0** -  Computer Science is the study of money making Algorithms  
**tl;dr 1** -  [Algorithm is a Mapping] = Functional Mapping of Input Data (graph ADT) to Output Data (graph ADT)  
**tl;dr 2** -  "[Practically everything (_including an algorithm_) is a Graph.][Everything is a graph]"

But **why**? Inspired by

### Conceptual
| Term          | Description |
|---------------|:------------|
| Computer Science | is the study of special type of functions (a.k.a. Algorithms) |
| Problem Solving| The ultimate goal of computer scientists |
| Algorithm   |  a _solution_ to a problem; a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise; is a special form of function (a mapping); is the [data model]? |
| Data | The generic name for input and output that is provided to a function, represented usually by a combination of special cases of a Graph, from single variable to linear and non-linear data structures |
| Graph       | the most general purpose description of representing data for an algorithm; an abstract data type; An example of one of [the simplest types of graphs is a singly linked list]!|
| Function    | a combination of [constructs][Constructs] referred to as "steps" that implement a specific algorithm |
| Input       | data (a set of variables) that is provided to a function to generate the output, can be represented as a Graph |
| Output      | The return value _(s)_ of a function, can be represented as a Graph |
| Complexity| Computer science also is about optimization; efficient use of time and space; Space and time complexity analysis; [Big O Notation]

### Trends
| Term          | Description |
|---------------|:------------|
| Machine Learning (ML) | A branch of statistics and computer science; Data mining, one of the categories of ML is enabled by Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD) which refers to the broad process (_a.k.a._ algorithmic patterns) of finding knowledge (_a.k.a._ patterns) in the Input dataset. **In other words, ML is all about patterns (in the form of functions) finding other patterns (in data)**. *“The more data, the better the algorithms. And the better the algorithms, the better the quality of service offered by Amazon, Facebook or Google. This is the positive feedback law of machine learning. Previous sources of market power have been patents (Xerox), network externalities (IBM) and government regulations and franchises (AT&T). All of these still matter, of course, in the age of the internet. But machine learning as a source of competitive advantage adds another, technological driver whereby those whose offerings — for whatever initial reason — achieve market leadership are endowed with an amplifying ability continuously to improve their relative market position.”* - read more at https://medium.economist.com/will-big-data-create-a-new-untouchable-business-elite-8dc23bcaa7cb |
| Artifical Intelligence (AI) | Computational algorithms that intend to replicate human intelligence and, ideally, improve upon it. For example, http://j.mp/marketingAI |

### Programming Related 
_Theory influences design; design influences programming._

| Term          | Description |
|---------------|:------------|
| Design Pattern| In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution (_a.k.a._ algorithm) to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. |
| **MVC** Pattern | MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns. Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.|
|Unified Modeling Language| **UML** is a common language for business analysts, software architects and developers used to describe, specify, design, and document existing or new business processes, structure and behavior of artifacts of software systems. An example of a [MVC diagram](#mvc-uml) is provided below.|
| Object| Objects are the coupling of Function and Data; A region of storage with associated semantics. After the declaration `int i;` we say that "i is an object of type int." In OO/C++, "object" usually means "an instance of a class." Thus a class defines the behavior of possibly many objects (instances). In other words, a class is a blueprint based on which objects are created. 
| Abstraction | Layers "hidden under the hood" to simplify the solution development; An email send request from application layer is handled by the series of network layers under the hood. The programmer only uses an interface(function call) from the layer below without knowing its implementation details. You can build/expand the features of one layer without affecting other. Abstraction is the cleaner way to arrange/build the complex system in layers. |
| OOP _(PDS-2)_| Object oriented programming concepts including encapsulation, inheritance and [polymorphism](http://bit.ly/PolyVideoKG) ; by way of an example, here's a C++ STL graph implementation for a [family tree](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/graph/example/family-tree-eg.cpp)
| Data Structure _(PDS_1)_| Specific programming structures used for implementing abstract data type like a [graph] ADT; an array, a linked list, a hashmap; here are some new [functional data structures](http://bit.ly/functionalDS)|
| [Constructs] _(FOCP)_ | Building blocks of a program - there are 7 fundamental ones (variables, sequences, selection, repetition, function (aka sub-routines), indirection and recursion); and then there are [31 variants]
| Problem sets | A carefully curated set of problems to achieve specific learning outcomes; increase your familiarity C language constructs by tackling the problem set at http://bit.ly/kitepc1  | 
| Programming | The _art_ of writing programs/code to accomplish problem solving using efficient algorithms |
| Program |An organized list of instructions that, when executed, causes the computer to behave in a predetermined manner|
| Pseudocode| Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of a computer program (_a.k.a_ algorithm). It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Variable declarations, system specific code and some subroutines are omitted. |
| Code Optimization|A method of code modification to improve code quality and efficiency|
| TDD | Test driven development, an important coding skill that is recommended for fresh talent that is entering the industry |
| API | Application Programming Interface, the implementation of an algorithm in a specific language/technology; The API in the [APIs Are Eating The World]
| Memory| Physical entities (bits, nibbles, CPU registers, cache, RAM, disk, tape) that help store and retrieve data |
| Internet | The internetwork (internet) of machines enables the interaction between anything (human-machine/machine-machine/human-human) from anywhere at anytime. The internet extends your memory unlimited. With the internet, you can access ‘everything’. |

### Interesting! 
| Term          | Description |
|:---------------|:------------|
| Algorithm Etymology| Etymologically, the word 'algorithm' is a combination of the Latin word `algorismus`, named after `Al-Khwarizmi`, a 9th-century Persian mathematician, and the Greek word `arithmo`, meaning "number"|
| Graph Algorithms | [Graph algorithms = Iterations + Data Structure?]| 
| Deterministic vs Non-deterministic| A computer program indeed implements a function, i.e. it maps to the input values to some uniquely defined output values. There are two **exceptions** to be considered: a program can be non-deterministic, meaning that different runs won't generate the same output; a program may fail to terminate, meaning that you are outside the domain of definition. Is implementing a [Syracuse Algorithm] non-deterministic? |
| Everything is a Graph| “So in a sense, graphs can give us an equivalent yet complementary view to the object-oriented paradigm. In OO we have objects; in graphs we have nodes. In OO, we have "relations between objects"; in graphical models we have edges. So we can conclude that Everything is a Graph.” http://buff.ly/2fx7JBU 
| Practically, everything is a graph | Read about the propaganda  [here](http://www.tcl-sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~cornell/prolog/Propaganda.html) and [here](http://www.tcl-sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~cornell/prolog/Graphs001.html) as well |
| Structural Programming|is an archetype to achieve clarity, quality and reduced development time by making extensive use of modularity with only three constructs: sequence, selection and iteration |
| Why Structural Programming?| It is a precursor to OOP. **Edsger W.Dijkstra** pervasively used [Structurpoal Programming] as a way to avoid [spaghetti code]. It is a logical thinking approach to solve a problem in all areas by applying decomposition to generate a hierarchical structure.|
| Why Functional Programming?| The latest (and final?) paradigm shift to  take advantage of the Utility computing era (aka Cloud Computing) which provides tremendous computing power on tap at exceptionally low cost compared to ownership.
| Functional programming|  is a programming paradigm that conceives computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to imperative programming, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. Functional programming is defined more by a set of common concerns and themes than any list of distinctions from other paradigms. Often considered important are higher-order and first-class functions, closures, and recursion. Other common features of functional programming languages are continuations, Hindley-Milner type inference systems, non-strict evaluation (including, but not limited to, "laziness"), and monads. |
| Three laws | The computing capacity doubles every 18 months (Moore). The storage capacity doubles every 12 months (Kryder). The internet bandwidth doubles every 24 months (Nielsen).|
