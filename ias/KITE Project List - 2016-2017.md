#### Hadoop Related Projects (Reference : https://wildanm.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/project-ideas-for-hadoop/)
1. A Performance Analysis of MapReduce Task with Large Number of Files Dataset in Big Data Using Hadoop.
2. Implement a continuous, large scale version of spycrawler on Amazon's platform.
3. Develop an image processing framework that takes overlapping images, warps these images to a common reference frame and detects sources within the multispectral stack.This will use the Hadoop map and shuffle operations to warp and detect sources (map) and then merge the source lists (shuffle). The data will be 30TB of images from the SDSS and 2MASS imaging surveys. 
4. Create a traffic predictor, using historical traffic data (Google can help in obtaining data).Depending on the team size and time, interesting things to add to the predictor to make it more accurate/interesting would include things such as 

	- weather and special events. 
	- Word bigrams, compute frequencies for word1 word2 pairs - could create a concordance index too.
	- City "bigram" distances - build a table of distances from city to city using geodata from previous exercises
