##Message Reader
><p>The main aim of this application is to make user to listen to their messages when ever they receive an message.This application is based on converting text to speech format of received message. When a sender sends a message, the receiver will receive a message in audio format instead of Text. The receiver can reply via text quickly.</p> 


><p>The text message will be handled within Message Reader will only intercept the new message in order to be able to speak it to you, but your proper installed application. If you have Message Reader activated, and one message arrives to your phone, the process will be the following one:</p>



	1. Message Reader detects the new message using a broadcast receiver (until this moment the app has not been wasting battery)
	2. Starts a background service with the TTS system, when all the work is done, Message Reader will start to speak the message.
	3. While the Message Reader is active, your phone OS (Android) saves your new messages and usually generates a new notification and your Message Reader app will alert you. For example, I have a SMS ‘X’ and after Message Reader reads the message, I can also manually read the SMS in SMS ‘X’.

></p>The main characteristics are:</p>

	- The application reads all SMS text messages by voice, the moment you get them.
	- It reads the contact name from your address phone book instead of the phone number.
	- Abbreviations management (add / edit / delete your own abbreviations).
	- Message Reader will not waste phone battery. Message Reader will be active only when the SMS arrives.
	- Language settings are automatically detected from phone location and language configuration.

>#####Existing System
><p>The present messaging system includes the manual opening and going through the message received by the receiver whenever he/she receives a message. Because of this the receiver cannot be hands-free due to the received message. The receiver may not have the knowledge of the message received even without having glimpse at it.</p>
