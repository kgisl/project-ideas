TORONTO: Tiny drones outfitted with a miniature arm that holds ink-soaked sponge may soon be able to create huge paintings and outdoor murals, thanks to a new software developed by scientists.
Paul Kry from the McGill University in Canada and his students teamed up to programme tiny drones to create dot drawings - an artistic technique known as stippling.
Programming the aerial robots to apply each payload of ink accurately and efficiently requires complex algorithms to plan flight paths and adjust for positioning errors, researchers said.
Even very slight air currents can toss the featherweight drones off course.
