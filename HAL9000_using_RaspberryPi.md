> **HAL9000** is a fictional character in **Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey** series. First appearing in 2001: A Space Odyssey, **HAL (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer)** is a sentient computer (or artificial general intelligence) that controls the systems of the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with the ship's astronaut crew.

> HAL9000 is a personal assistance like the **[Amazon echo](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E)** and the upcoming **[Google home](https://home.google.com/)**. Isn't that cool :sunglasses: !

Building your own voice controlled HAL9000 for a ~$100. Build it **[here](http://www.instructables.com/id/RaspberryPI-HAL9000/)**, with the step by step instructions. Using a Raspberry PI computer with some other computer components, and a custom acrylic box to create this iconic computer from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.
