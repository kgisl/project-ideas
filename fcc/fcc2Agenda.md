"Agile Engineering for the Web" - the same title can be used for the talk. 
And it can be conceptualized and delivered in two stages - 
Part 1 and Part 2 (for a future date, along with FCC, or stand-alone as well). 
This event can happen parallel to the FCC-2-Sprint (towards 10,000 challenges).

Community how to setup a "Continuous integration + Continuous deployment"
