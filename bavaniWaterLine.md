#Bavani Waterline

Team, 
The entire water pumping mechanism is managed by PSG using automated pumping sytem right from Bavani to their doorstep. 

I meet with Dr Vinod (HOD of Robotics and Automation) and he shared this with me. 
This can also be a good project for ECE/Mech students. 

Dr Paramasivam (PSG Tech professor, who stays in Keeranatham) can be contacted for more details on this. 
+91-98401-05091. 

Mr Ganapathy (ex-TNEB, ex-ABB) now working with KGDS can probably present a nice PLC design as well.
