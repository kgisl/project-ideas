# Generate ToC 

**Skills Required**:  HTML, CSS and Javascript and basic familiarity (especially headers) with the Markdown format. 

## The Challenge 

**Prize:** KGISL **Bronze Badge** and upto Rs 2,500 for a working solution. Approach this individually or as a team. **Deadline: Aug 15, 2017**

- It is quite straightforward to generate a table of contents (ToC) in Microsoft Word. Take a look at this video here -  http://bit.ly/gitHubFCC 

- Given a Markdown file (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header), make  recommendations on how a table of contents (ToC) can be generated for it. 

- Specifically, codify a solution for generating a ToC for markdown files on github. Enhance the available github editor (https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) so that the ToC can be generated/updated while editing the github repo file from within the browser. To accomplish this, there might be some setup that is required. The less setup that is required, the better. 

## Additional Notes for Solution

 - the solution must help generate **ToC** for 
	 - wiki pages (e.g https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/wiki) when the user clicks on the "Edit" button next to the green "New Page" button, on the right hand side
	 - markdown files in the repo (e.g. https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/blob/master/Admin_FAQ.md) when the user clicks on the pencil icon next to the History button on the right hand side, below the "Copy path" button
	 - gist pages (e.g. https://gist.github.com/kgashok/1be5157b5c2225b5948cc73d153bf531) when the user clicks the "Edit" button next to the "Delete" icon on the top right hand side 

## Example 

The gist page (https://gist.github.com/kgashok/1be5157b5c2225b5948cc73d153bf531) has a table of contents, which is what we need to create based on any given page (wiki, md file or gist file on **github**).

The **ToC** in the above image is based on the markdown code that is to be generated by the solution, and it has the format as shown below. The indentations can be either implemented with tabs or spaces (2 for each tab).

# Guidelines

- Finding existing solutions/projects/tools (open source or otherwise) and re-purposing them to achieve the below objective is highly encouraged. Don't reinvent something that is also working well. 
- Hack on something that already works but has some quirks and does not match what is exactly required 
- Simplify the problem to something that you think you can get going right away
