Sanjay Jain, Pramod Varma, Ranga Raj

With a lot of momentum being built around Digital India and Smart Cities, we offer 
a contrarian view of how government agencies and stakeholders should approach this

some that are non-technology related – political, bureaucratic, architectural, social, 
cultural etc.,  and others that are technology driven. We will focus on technology led 
aspects and approaches to Smart Cities in this blog.
