Traditionally, since the very beginning of the computing era, enterprise software development has faced one challenge when, naturally, it is supposed to be focused on solving real business problems, but at the same time developers have to spend significant time and efforts on the technical side of the solution, such as architecture and generic functionality implementation.
In response to this disbalance between technical focused and problem oriented programming, a number of frameworks emerged, which were intended to raise the abstraction level and release developers from low level routine. Also, to increase development efficiency, development tools have become smarter and smarter over years. One of the best examples of the early 2000s is Borland Delphi, which hugely increased development speed of desktop applications.
In the past decade enterprise software has evolved a lot, raising the need for a new generation of high productivity frameworks and development tools. So, in this article we will have a look at the CUBA Platform – an open source framework, combining solid architecture, ‘must have’ features of any enterprise application and rapid application development tools, aimed to boost development productivity.


### Cuba based Taxi management software
Here's an idea: Take KGISL's call taxi software and migrate it to CUBA platform

### Build a Transportation-as-a-service (TAAS)

THE FIVE COMPONENTS OF TRANSPORTATION-AS-A-SERVICE
Drivers and riders are important to understanding the future of transportation-as-a-service (TaaS), but they are not the only pieces that matter — and not the only areas where Uber still has an advantage. I see five components that really matter:

- Drivers
- Cars
- Mapping
- Routing
- Riders

### Implement the equivalent of UberPool using Traveling Salesman Problem 

First, as Gurley’s title suggests, getting the algorithms behind UberPool right is an incredibly complex problem. It’s basically the [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) on steroids, and the only real way to solve it is to slowly but surely work out heuristics that work in real world situations. Combine that reality with the fact that Uber has a dominant share of drivers and riders, giving the company sufficient liquidity to offer UberPool in multiple markets, and the result is that Uber is undoubtedly far ahead of competitors — present and potential — in solving these problems.
