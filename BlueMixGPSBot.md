### Enhance KGISL's GPS system using BlueMix


There is already a code base which needs to be understood. 
It needs to be modified to support Mobile user interaction with KGISL's Hybrid AutoBots. 

You need to use the Voice-recognition and Natural language classifiers (NLCs) available on 
IBM BlueMix to implement this solution. 


### Alternative - Use Python
