# Soft Skills Challenges 

The KGISL's SSA Academy (http://ssa.kgisl.com) can help improve your soft skills quotient dramatically. 
Their services come at no cost to all committed FreeCodeCamp web developers @KGISL Campus. 

## Top Level Challenge List (this is _very_ fluid right now) 

0. Be confident and at the same time be tolerant of ambiguity - 
1. Write and record a 59 second video about yourself - read the [guidelines](59second.md)
2. Deliver a 20x20 PechaKucha presentation on your F.I.T. portfolio - TBP (to be published) 
  - deliver a PK on your top 10 soft skills
3. As is the case with coding, practice your language skills daily 
   - http://www.vocabulary.com - will deliver one word a day 
   - http://noredink.com - will improve your written grammar skills 
   - Write about your FCC progress (or any other matter) in your Medium [blog](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-quickly-learn-anything-and-become-more-than-you-ever-thought-possible-cb44dd592461#.raymy6olt)
