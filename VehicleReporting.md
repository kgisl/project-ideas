[28/05, 07:15] Sasidharan: Vehicle Identification sms system :Very Good initiative by Modi government

Any vehicle on the road, if you want to know the name of the owner, it is very simple. Just type VAHAN space Vehicle No and send to 7738299899 , you can get the owner of the vehicle in return SMS, thanx to "DIGITAL INDIA" it will be easy to complain on vehicles who do not follow traffic rules, and commit Road Accidents.....

Eg.
VAHAN MH12GFXXXX

A very good msg...please save the number. 
Tried and tested.
