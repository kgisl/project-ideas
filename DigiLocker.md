**DigiLocker** is an initiative by the government to offer Indian citizens a free platform to store and access important documents. 
The platform uses several open source technologies to deliver a mass solution and contributes back to the ever-growing community.

Nayak is leading an in-house development team of just around 14 people who have developed DigiLocker. 
The team includes some government personnel as well as individuals from private firms.

“Our technical team is a mix of people with a background in **PHP, Java, .NET and Python**, and we prefer those with previous experience in open source technologies. 
We have individuals from various domains such as the government, banking, insurance, services and products,” Nayak says.
