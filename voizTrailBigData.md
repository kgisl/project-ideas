### Goal: "100% response rate!"

On an average we have at least 100+ missed calls at KG Hospital. 
VoizTrail is a solution developed by KGfSL and can provide data on this.
Use Big Data and implement a solution which can eliminate (or minimize) missed calls.

### Current capability 
This feature is one of the main features of Voiztrail and with this detail the call centre inbound man power allocation can be done and this is also one of our USP in selling Voiztrail. An US collections company allocates collectors through this data from Voiztrail  which has helped them to identify number of collectors to be available on a particular day and time.


## Data Sets

Can BigData help come up with a better optimization of workforce allotment?
