## GOAL:  
- We need to create a Guinness Record. We need a counter to count number of challenges completed
in a specific period of time. 
- For this we need a counter of participants and their respective challenge completions.

# Special CamperBot
- Issue already flagged at https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot/issues/75

1. CamperBot - Fundamental requirement is to implement Command including Count, Yesterday's Count, Today's Count, Diff betweem days.

### Enhanced Requirements (Apr 21 2016)
  1.	Count: It should return the overall count of the problems solved in FCC by  a specific gitter chat room members
      -	Example:  count @kgisl/campsite -> It should return 1500 problems (Total problems solved by all the members in kgisl/campsite)
  2.	Yesterday’s Count: It should return yesterday’s count of the problems solved in FCC by  a specific  gitter chat room members
      -	Example: Yesterday’s count @kgisl/campsite – It should return 1000 problems
  3.	Today’s Count It should return today’s  count of the problems solved in FCC by  a specific  gitter chat room members
      -	Example : Today’s count @kgisl/campsite - It should return 500 problems
  4.	Diff between two or more days: It should return the difference between two or more days (days can be specified by the user).
      -	Example: Diff @kgisl/campsite  -> bot should asks for dates - > 20-04-2016 21-04-2016 -> It should return 500
      -	Assume count for 20-04-2016 is 1000 and 21-04-2016 count is 1500 : 1500 – 1000 -> 500
  5.	Max: It should return the name of the member who contributed maximum problems in FCC.
      -	Max @kgisl/campsite -> 245 | @parisudhaandireyaa | http://www.freecodecamp.com/parisudhaandireyaa
  6.	Min: It should return the name of the member who contributed minimum problems in FCC.
      -	Min @kgisl/campsite -> 10 | @xyz | http://www.freecodecamp.com/xyz
  7.	About @username can be modified to accept two or more members.
      -	About @kgashok @ddrdushy  -> it should give the following result
      
        i.	155 | @kgashok | http://www.freecodecamp.com/kgashok

        ii.	245 | @ddrdushy | http://www.freecodecamp.com/ddrdushy	
        
#### Standalone Counter for FCC https://github.com/kgisl/FCC-Status

### Idea for Visualization (using a plot.ly) 
 - https://bmcorser.github.io/assets/html/elm-packages/
 - https://plot.ly/

### Flexible configuration 
This slack server that self-invites people to a channel (gitter room) is also a likely possibility
